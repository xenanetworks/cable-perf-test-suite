# Xena Cable Performance Optimization Methodology

In high-speed networking, signal integrity is everything. Whether it’s 100G, 400G, or 800G links, ensuring a low bit error rate (BER) is key to maintaining stable, high-performance data transmission. Two critical tuning parameters—RX Output Equalization and TX Input Equalization—play a major role in making sure transceivers and hosts work together smoothly. However, manually adjusting these settings is time-consuming and inconsistent, especially as data rates increase.

This test suite provides an automated optimization framework that uses PRBS-based BER testing to dial in RX Output Equalization and TX Input Equalization for the best possible signal integrity, aligning with IEEE 802.3ck and CMIS standards.

## Why Xena Cable Performance Optimization Methodology?

* Eliminates manual equalization tuning, saving time for network engineers.
* Optimizes transceivers for low BER and high signal integrity across all lanes.
* Fully compliant with CMIS and IEEE 802.3ck, ensuring industry-standard performance.
* Automates PRBS-based stress testing to verify link stability.

By integrating automated RX Output Equalization and TX Input Equalization tuning, Xena Cable Performance Optimization Methodology delivers a consistent, repeatable, and high-performance transceiver optimization process, ensuring reliable network links in data centers, high-speed interconnects, and enterprise networking environments.
