RX Output EQ Test Design
========================

Principle Flow
--------------

The principle of all the tests is to find the RX Ouput EQ settings that reduce the PRBS bit error rate to satisfy a critera. The tests are based on the CMIS standard page/reg addresses. The tests are automated and can be run on Xena test equipment with Z800 Freya modules.

1. Check if the transceiver module supports the EQ control as described in `RX Output EQ Advertisement`_.

    * If the transceiver module supports EQ control, the test can be run. Else, the test will abort.

2. Start PRBS-31 test pattern transmission from the TX port to the RX port, and measure the PRBS BER at the RX port. The measurement is set to accumulative mode to get a stable BER value after a certain duration.
3. Deinitialize the Data Path associated with host lane. All lanes of a Data Path must have the same value. This is implemented by writing ``Page 10h Register 128`` with value ``0xFF``.
4. Read Data Path Configuration of each lane. This is implemented by reading ``Page 10h Register 145 - 152``. The purpose is to cache the ``AppSelCode`` and ``DataPathID`` values because we don't want to change them during the test. What we want to change is the ``ExplicitControl`` bit.
5. Write the RX output EQ settings to the RX Output EQ registers. This is implemented by writing ``Page 10h Register 162 - 173``. Depending on the search algorithm, optimal or target, the sequence of RX output EQ writing can be different.
6. Write the Explicit Control bit to 1. This is implemented by writing ``Page 10h Register 145 - 152`` with the cached ``AppSelCode`` and ``DataPathID`` values and the ``ExplicitControl`` bit set to 1.
7. Trigger the Provision procedure via an ``ApplyDPInit`` register ``Page 10h Register 143`` by writing ``0xFF``.
8. Activate the Data Path associated with the host lane. This is implemented by writing ``Page 10h Register 128`` with value ``0x00``.
9. Wait for a certain duration to let the EQ settings take effect.
10. Clear PRBS BER counter. Read the PRBS BER at the RX port for a certain duration, and save the last reading.
11. For the optimal test, an exhaustive search is performed to find the RX output EQ settings that yield the lowest PRBS BER. Thus, the test will repeat Step 3 - 10 for all possible RX output EQ settings. 
12. For the target test, an iterative algorithm will find the RX output EQ settings that satisfy the target BER criteria, not necessarily the lowest BER. Thus, the test will repeat Step 3 - 10 until the target BER criteria is satisfied.

RX Equalizer Control
--------------------

RX EQ (RX output equalizer control) settings can be directly written and applied for RX output equalization if RX Output Controls are Supported.

RX Output EQ Advertisement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    RX Output EQ Advertisement

The RX Ouput EQ Advertisement: ``Page 01h Byte 162``, as defined in :numref:`cmis_rx_eq_support`, can be used to check if the module supports RX output equalization control.

RX Output EQ Register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmis_rx_output_eq_reg:

    RX Output EQ Registers

RX Output EQ register control: ``Page 10h Byte 162 â€“ 173``, as defined in :numref:`cmis_rx_output_eq_reg`, can be used to control the RX output EQ settings.
