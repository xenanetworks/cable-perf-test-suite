Introduction
============

As data center networks continue to scale, ensuring optimal signal integrity in high-speed interconnects has become a critical engineering challenge. With the increasing adoption of 100G, 400G, and 800G transceivers, equlization tuning play a major role in making sure transceivers and hosts work together smoothly. 

Cable manufacturers can suffer from maual equalization tuning when trying to validate their high-speed cables, as the process can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

To increase work efficiency and accuracy, **Xena Cable Performance Optimization Methodology** provides an automated cable optimization method, allowing customers to quickly and accurately test their transceivers and cables with Xena's high-performance test equipment `Z800 Freya <https://xenanetworks.com/freya-800g-pam4-ethernet-testing-112gbps-serdes/>`_.
